Contributing to iiag
====================

Before you submit a pull request, make sure you are doing things sensibly!

  * Pull request should solve an issue, if there is not an issue, make one.
    Put `fixes #n`, `resovles #n` or the like in the pull requests' initial comment.
  * Commits should do one thing, massive commits that do many things are bad bad bad.
  * Stick to the coding style.

Coding Style
------------

* Don't commit trailing spaces, they mess with diffs!
