Contributing to iiag
====================

Before you submit a pull request, make sure you are doing things sensibly!

  * If a pull request solves an issue, if there is not an issue, put `fixes #n`,
    `resovles #n` or the like in the pull requests' initial comment. See the keywords
    [here](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) for
    those that automatically close issues.
  * Commits should do one thing, massive commits that do many things are bad.
  * Somebody other than the author of a pull request should review the pull request
    before it is merged into master.
  * Stick to the coding style.

* Don't commit trailing spaces, they mess with diffs!
