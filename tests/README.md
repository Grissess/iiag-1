To add a test, simply add a file by the name of `test.c` to a subdirectory of this
`tests` directory.

The `test.c` file will be compiled like a normal C program, and you can include
things found in the `src/` directory. Make sure to print something useful
and exit with a non-zero status code when your tests fail!
